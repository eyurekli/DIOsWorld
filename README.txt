New version v0.2!
-Jotaro's movement has been improved
Comments: Jotaro now moves more smoothly, rather than one direction at a time.. Sprite animations, but most importantly attacks, to be added in the future.
It has been a while since the release. First principles of derrivatives was not very fun to deal with in the last month. But the derrivative rules are fun though. 
Love the chain rule. Until the next update!
